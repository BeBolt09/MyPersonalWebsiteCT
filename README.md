# Welcome to My first Coding Temple Assignment !
##This website is a demonstration of my html and css skills

I used two pages.
In the first page we can find my name, a nice background image, a list of "my works" and a contact form.
There's also a navigation bar at the top to help users redirect to my about page.

In this about page I simply talked about myself and users can redirect to the Home page by clicking on my LOGO.
