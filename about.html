                <h1>Hi, I'm <span>Sebastien Dupont</span> <br></h1>
                <p class="para">Hello, I'm Sebastien Dupont, a 20-year-old with 
                    a unique blend of Belgian roots and American 
                    upbringing. Originally hailing from the picturesque 
                    south of Belgium, I spent the first 14 years of my 
                    life immersed in the rich cultural tapestry woven by 
                    my Belgian father and American mother. Seeking new 
                    horizons, I made the transatlantic leap to Santa 
                    Barbara, California, where I delved into the vibrant 
                    realm of American high school life. The allure of the 
                    West Coast proved irresistible, leading me to Santa 
                    Barbara City College, where I dedicated two years to the 
                    study of computer science. Now calling San Diego home, 
                    I am passionately pursuing opportunities in the tech 
                    industry, fueled by a genuine love for innovation and 
                    problem-solving.</p>

                <p class="para">Beyond the realm of coding and algorithms, soccer has been a constant thread weaving through 
                    the fabric of my life for over 15 years. A daily fitness enthusiast, I find equilibrium in 
                    the disciplined routine of my workouts. Eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to the 
                    dynamic world of technology, I am poised and ready to embark on the next chapter of my 
                    professional journey.</p>

                <p class="para">In the dynamic realm of technology, my passion extends beyond academics and workouts. 
                    Whether staying abreast of the latest in computer science or engaging in innovative 
                    projects, I'm driven by unbridled curiosity. Beyond seeking a tech job, I aspire to 
                    contribute my skills to projects that redefine possibilities. From Belgium's cobblestone 
                    streets to California's tech hubs, I've cultivated resilience and adaptability. 
                    With soccer as a testament to my discipline, I offer a well-rounded perspective and 
                    unwavering determination in every pursuit.</p>
